        paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single 
        topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into 
        paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and
         thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

        Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief 
        examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; 
        narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe 
        causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics.
         One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.
         <br>
        
        <br>TOPIC SENTENCES<br>
        <br>

        A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called 
        the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s thesis
         statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader of 
         the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in
          a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence
           at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the 
           topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background information.
        
        Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a topic
         sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events, if a paragraph
          continues developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph, or if all the sentences and 
          details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should
           have a topic sentence.
        
        PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE
        Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structure—introduction, body, and conclusion. You can see this structure in
         paragraphs whether they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing information. Each part of the
          paragraph plays an important role in communicating your meaning to your reader.
        
        Introduction: the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at the beginning
         of the paragraph that give background information or provide a transition.
        
        Body: follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples, and other information.
